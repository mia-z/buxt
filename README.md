## <p align="center">Filesystem-route based REST API server for Bun.js</p>

<p align="center">If you've ever used NextJs's routing system, then you should already be familiar with this concept. In short, it creates routes based off the directory structure under the folder "routes" in the root of the project. Exporting a defult function is all you need to do to get things working, the rest is handled automatically.
